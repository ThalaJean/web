              <p>The College of Engineering (COE) kicked off the academic year with their 1st General Assembly and Teacher's Day celebration on October 30th at the Science & Engineering Laboratory Building (SELB) Annex. 
                The event served as a dual celebration, recognizing the dedication of faculty members and student officers.
                The COE-Student Body Organization (SBO) led the introduction and awarding ceremony for student officers. 
                This ceremony formally recognized their positions and contributions, and included an oathtaking to uphold their duties. </p>
              <p>The COE-SBO then presented their action plan and calendar of activities, outlining a year focused on leadership development, team building, and other engaging events. 
                A Q&A session followed to answer any questions about the planned activities.
                To foster a positive atmosphere, the COE-SBO Program Committee led an icebreaker activity for faculty members. </p>
              <p>This activity paved the way for a fun and memorable Teacher's Day celebration. 
                Students also prepared a touching video montage for the faculty, showcasing their appreciation for their instructors' dedication.
                The celebration continued with a program honoring outstanding educators, as voted by students. 
                This recognition further emphasized the faculty's valuable role in shaping students' futures. 
                While a single event cannot fully express the importance of teachers, this celebration served as a powerful way for students to express gratitude. </p>
              <p> The event ultimately aimed to strengthen the connection and mutual respect between faculty and students, fostering a college environment built on excellence and positivity. </p>
